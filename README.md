- [react-id-swiper](https://github.com/kidjp85/react-id-swipe) modern mobile touch slider.
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and syntax.
- [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/) for bundling code down to a single file and enabling hot module reloading.

## Getting Started

In order to get started developing, you'll need to do a few things first.

1. Install all of the `node_modules` required for the package. Depending on your computer's configuration.

```
git clone https://github.com/mntsB/recommended-movies.git
```

```
cd recommended-movies
```

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

2. Lastly, run the start command to get the project off the ground. This command will not only build your JS files using the Webpack `dev-server`, but it will also auto-compile your Sass files on every `.scss` file save.

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

4. Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app live!
